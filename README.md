# Meal Tracker

#### A web app to track information about meals eaten and display meals by date and/or caloric content.

#### By Molly McGlone, August 2016

## Description:

An Epicodus independent student project to practice building a modern Javascript app using the Angular2 framework and a gulp-based asset pipeline and development server.

User Stories:

* As a user, I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, where I got it, my rating, calories, the date, and details.
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want the option to view all the foods I ate on a particular day.
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
